Subject: [PATCH] Fix CraftServer#isPrimaryThread and MinecraftServer
 isMainThread

md_5 changed it so he could shut down the server asynchronously
from watchdog, although we have patches that prevent that type
of behavior for this exact reason.

md_5 also placed code in PlayerConnectionUtils that would have
solved https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-142590, making the change
to MinecraftServer#isMainThread irrelevant.
By reverting his change to MinecraftServer#isMainThread packet
handling that should have been handled synchronously will be handled
synchronously when the server gets shut down.
